Of course it’s up for opinion (I don’t want to start a debate), I mean religion is a pretty big, scary and sometimes extreme opinion but I don’t believe in anything other than fact which, unfortunately for my religious background, excludes any notion of a God. It fascinates me however, how the human mind has conjured ideas of greater beings, the need to feel inferior to something more grand or that events are not coincidence and are controlled by another power. It just doesn’t take my fancy. We were not put on this earth for any purpose, we are just the product of incredible odds and an inconcievable amount of time. There is no such thing as the matrix, magic or unicorns.</p><p name="0466" class="graf--p"><a id="0466"></a>There is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">one thing</em> though that makes me question the above.</p><h3 name="b9ee" class="graf--h3"><a id="b9ee"></a>Enter Deja-vu</h3><p name="dd07" class="graf--p"><a id="dd07"></a>I had a headache today, a bad one. A throbbing, stabbing pain above my left eye that incapacitated me for most of the day during the Easter festivities with the family. Each family member took their time to give me an armchair diagnosis which, of course, was incredibly loving and caring but considering the nature of the pain, my patience was weary and courtesy was running dangerously low. Fortunately, we had two qualified nurses in the house who we kind enough to assess me. It was during this second assessment, my head nearly exploded, not because of the headache, but because of Deja-vu. Forgive the hyperbole, but it was intense. Usually, Deja-vu for me would be “wow, have I been here before?” or vaguely remembering an event happening. This incident however, as she entered the room and asked me how I was doing and the ensuing conversation was so clear that I was actually able to anticipate every word she said, like a song. I was effectively mouthing the words in my head (if that makes sense) as she was speaking.</p><p name="cdd3" class="graf--p"><a id="cdd3"></a>I was stunned. How is this possible? Time is linear. Unless it is in the past, it is impossible to understand <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">completely</em> the outcome of an event. You can predict the outcome (and be correct) but in the greater sense, it’s impossible to see into the future.</p><blockquote name="9516" class="graf--blockquote"><a id="9516"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Déjà vu</strong>, (<a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Help:IPA for English">/</a><a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English%23Key" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English%23Key" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Help:IPA for English">ˌdeɪʒɑː</a> <a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English%23Key" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English%23Key" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Help:IPA for English">ˈvuː</a><a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHelp%3AIPA_for_English" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Help:IPA for English">/</a>) from <a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFrench_language" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFrench_language" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="French language">French</a>, literally “already seen”, is the <a href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhenomenon" data-href="/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhenomenon" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a> of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not.</blockquote><p name="fe50" class="graf--p"><a id="fe50"></a>Apparently it was all in my head.

Why, if we have this ability, do we see the most insignificant events and only realise it’s the future when we’re experiencing it? Because life sucks, that’s why. We’d have a lot more Final Destination style train wrecks running around fucking with our paranoia settings</p></div></div></section>
